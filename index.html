                  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07779">Adventures in Supersingularland</a>
                  In this paper, we study isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves. Supersingular isogeny graphs were introduced as a hard problem into cryptography by Charles, Goren, and Lauter for the construction of cryptographic hash functions. These are large expander graphs, and the hard problem is to find an efficient algorithm for routing, or path-finding, between two vertices of the graph. We consider several aspects of supersingular isogeny graphs. A main one concerns two related graphs that help us understand the structure: the `spine', which is the subgraph of the isogney graph given by the j-invariants in Fp, and the graph G(Fp), in which both curves and isogenies must be defined over Fp. We show how to pass from the latter to the former. The graph G(Fp) is relevant for cryptanalysis because routing between vertices in Fp is easier than in the full isogeny graph. The Fp-vertices are typically assumed to be randomly distributed in the graph, which is far from true. We provide an analysis of the distances of connected components of S.

                  To better understand web security as it is experienced around the world, we scan the top 500 most visited sites of internet users from nine countries of interest. We document HTTPS usage, the public key encryption and signing algorithms, and certicate information, including issuing date and length of validity. Insights from this project will help benchmark web security prior to upcoming browser interventions, and identify regions that may benet from capacity building to implement TLS in the future.
